    "import socket: This brings in the socket module, which lets the program send and receive data over a network.\n",
    "import threading: This is used to run code in different threads at the same time, like doing two things at once.\n",
    "import time: This is used to make the program wait for a certain amount of time.\n",
    "Set Up Addresses:\n",
    "\n",
    "tello_address = ('192.168.10.1', 8889): This is the address of the Tello drone. It's like the drone's home address on the internet.\n",
    "local_address = ('', 9000): This is the address for your computer. It's like saying, \"I'll be waiting at door number 9000 to talk to the drone.\"\n",
    "Create a UDP Connection:\n",
    "\n",
    "sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM): This creates a new way for your computer to talk to other devices using UDP, which is a fast but simple type of internet communication.\n",
    "Bind to Local Address:\n",
    "\n",
    "sock.bind(local_address): This tells your computer to get ready to send and receive messages at door number 9000.\n",
    "Send Message Function:\n",
    "\n",
    "def send(message, delay): This is a set of instructions that lets you send a message to the drone.\n",
    "Inside the send function:\n",
    "It tries to send a message to the drone. If it can't, it will tell you there was an error.\n",
    "time.sleep(delay): After sending the message, it waits for a bit (this is the delay).\n",
    "Receive Message Function:\n",
    "\n",
    "def receive(): This set of instructions listens for messages from the drone.\n",
    "Inside the receive function:\n",
    "It keeps checking for messages from the drone. If it gets a message, it shows you what the message says.\n",
    "If there's a problem and it can't listen anymore, it will stop trying and tell you there was an error.\n",
    "Listening Thread:\n",
    "\n",
    "receiveThread = threading.Thread(target=receive): This creates a special task that can listen for drone messages while the rest of the program does other things.\n",
    "receiveThread.daemon = True: This makes sure that this special task doesn't keep running forever if the main program stops.\n",
    "receiveThread.start(): This starts the special task, so it begins listening for messages from the drone.\n",

    "\n",
    "for _ in range(num_squares): - This is like saying, \"Do the following steps a certain number of times.\" num_squares is how many times you want to do it. If num_squares is 3, it's like saying, \"Do the next steps 3 times.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside the first loop, there's another loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "for _ in range(4): - This is saying, \"Do the next steps 4 times.\" This is for flying in a square because a square has four sides.\n",
    "Inside this loop, there are two commands: send(\"forward \" + str(box_leg_distance), 4) and send(yaw_direction + \" \" + str(yaw_angle), 3). These are like telling the drone, \"Go forward a certain distance\" and then \"Turn a corner.\" Doing this four times makes the drone fly a square.\n",
    "send(\"up 100\", 4) - After flying a square, this tells the drone, \"Now go up 100 cm.\" This happens each time after the drone completes a square.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the drone flies a square, goes up, flies another square a little higher, goes up again, and keeps doing this until it has done it the number of times we told it to in num_squares."
